<h1>Zelda Guide Book</h1>

<h2>Walkthrough<h2>
<p>Zelda is an amazing game, but it is also very difficult. In the Walkthrough, I will explain how to do some pretty basic</p>
<p>things that will help near the beginning.</p>
<h3>1) Basic Controls</h3>
<p>The basic controls are moving, looking around, jumping, hitting, selecting, using the shield, shooting things(bow and 
  arrow), throwing your weapon, parigliding, shield surfing, using ruins, and various ways of dodging.</p>
<p>Moving and Looking Around: It's obvious that this will be needed throughout the entire game. the left joystick is used to 
move around, and the right joystick is used to look around.</p>
