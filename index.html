<h2>Walkthrough<h2>
<h4>Zelda is an amazing game, but it is also very difficult. In the Walkthrough, I will explain how to do some pretty basic</h4>
<h4>things that will help near the beginning.</h4>
<h3>1) Basic Controls</h3>
<h4>The basic controls are moving, looking around, jumping, hitting, selecting, using the shield, shooting things(bow and 
  arrow), throwing your weapon, parigliding, and shield surfing.</h4>
